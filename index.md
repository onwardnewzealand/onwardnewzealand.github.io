## Our Policies


### Immigration

Immigrants are a burden. They use our infrastructure that we built for ourselves at our expense. We will abolish all long-term visas.


### Foreign Affairs

Refugees are a burden. Half of them live on welfare and live in public housing. They cost us one billion dollars per year. They also commit many crimes. We will abolish the Refugee Quota Programme and the Immigration and Protection Tribunal.

We will abolish foreign aid.


### Citizenship

We are now one people. We will abolish Māori seats and Māori wards. We will repeal divisive legislation including section 73(1) of the Human Rights Act and similar.

We will abolish non-citizen voting in our elections. We will ban non-citizen political donations. We will ban non-citizen land ownership. We will abolish welfare and subsidies for non-citizens and they shall pay an infrastructure levy.


### Housing

Immigration is driving the housing crisis. See our immigration policy.


### Climate change

Immigration is driving climate change. See our immigration policy.
